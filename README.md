# Slow and steady wins the race: spatial and stochastic processes and the failure of suppression gene drives

Code, and data repository.

## Notes:

- Output figures of the analysis are in `out/no_TADS-NstaR5/`.
- `out/Figure_4-recursive_function_dataset.rds` is generated using the ouput of `driveChaseEcolFunctions.R::evolve()` function at $\sigma=10$, and the recursive equations are explicitly implemented in `src/misc/simple_plot_timeseries_ribbon.R`, which was used to generate `out/no_TADS-Nstar5/Figure_4-timeseries-simulated-deterministic.svg`.
